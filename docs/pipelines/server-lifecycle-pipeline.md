# Server Lifecycle Pipeline

Use this guide before editing server import/listing/persistence, start/stop/restart, backups, deletion, or process handling.

## Core Classes

- `controlador.GestorServidores`: central server manager.
- `modelo.Server`: server model, runtime process, console listeners, extension list.
- `modelo.ServerConfig`: persisted server config values.
- `controlador.ServerRuntime`: runtime helper.
- `controlador.ServerLogReader`: reads process output and forwards console lines.
- `controlador.DetectorTipoServidor`: legacy/server type detection.
- `controlador.DetectorVersionServidor`: version detection support.
- `controlador.platform.*`: modern platform detection, validation, startup command, creation.

## Managed Server List

`GestorServidores` owns the server collection and selected server.

Typical responsibilities:

- Load persisted servers.
- Add imported or newly created servers.
- Persist changes after reorder/favorite/edit.
- Expose `PropertyChangeSupport` events for UI panels.
- Keep selected server consistent.

Before changing persistence, inspect `GestorConfiguracion`, `EasyMCConfig`, `Server`, and tests in `GestorServidoresTest`.

## Start Pipeline

General sequence:

1. Resolve selected or requested `Server`.
2. Validate server directory.
3. Detect/resolve platform profile.
4. Locate executable jar if required.
5. Build a `ProcessBuilder` through the platform adapter or default Java jar path.
6. Start the process.
7. Store the `Process` in the `Server`.
8. Start `ServerLogReader` to stream logs.
9. Notify property listeners so UI controls update.

Platform adapters can customize start behavior through:

- `buildStartProcess(...)`
- `requiresExecutableJarForStart()`

Forge/NeoForge/Quilt may use generated argument files or special launch paths.

## Stop And Command Pipeline

Commands are written to the running process input stream.

Stop should prefer graceful server command behavior before killing the process. UI buttons should reflect whether the process exists and is alive.

## Import Pipeline

Importing an existing server should:

- Validate the selected folder.
- Detect platform/version where possible.
- Avoid corrupting or rewriting unknown server contents.
- Preserve user data.
- Add the server to the managed list only after validation succeeds.

## Delete/Remove Pipeline

There is a distinction between removing a server from the app and deleting files from disk. Keep UI copy clear and do not delete folders unless the flow explicitly asks for that destructive operation.

## Events And UI

Panels use `GestorServidores` property changes for state updates. If adding events, keep names stable and update consumers.

## Tests

Relevant tests:

- `src/test/java/controlador/GestorServidoresTest.java`
- `src/test/java/modelo/ServerModelPlatformTest.java`
- `src/test/java/controlador/platform/ServerPlatformAdaptersTest.java`

Run at least targeted tests when changing lifecycle, persistence, or platform detection.
